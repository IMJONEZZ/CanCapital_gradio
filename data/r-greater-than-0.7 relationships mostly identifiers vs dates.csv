"Pair","Correlation","Why it makes sense"
"contract_number ↔ funded_date","0.99","The contract ID encodes the funding date (e.g., sequential IDs)."
"funded_date ↔ collection_case_open_date","0.90","Collection usually opens shortly after funding; the two timestamps move together."
"contract_number ↔ collection_case_open_date","0.90","Same reason as above – ID carries a temporal component."
"collection_case_open_date ↔ last_payment_date","0.81","The most recent payment tends to occur after the case is opened, and later open dates push the last‑payment date forward."
"contract_number ↔ last_payment_date","0.77","Again a by‑product of the temporal ordering embedded in the ID."
"funded_date ↔ last_payment_date","0.77","Loans funded later have later payment histories."
