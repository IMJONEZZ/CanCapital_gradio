"Rank","Feature (raw column)","Mean permutation‑importance*","Std. dev.","How to read it"
"1","`days_past_due`","0.361","0.015","If you randomly shuffle the days past due values across loans, the MAE of the Gradient‑Boosting model goes up by ~0.36 × (average MAE). In plain English: how far a loan is already behind schedule is the single biggest driver of how long the collection case will stay open."
"2","`no_missed_payments`","0.140","0.012","The count of missed installments matters, but only about one‑third as much as “days past due”. Borrowers who have skipped many payments tend to generate longer collection cases."
"3","`days_lastpay_to_close`","0.034","0.005","The gap between the borrower’s last payment and the date the case is finally closed matters, but its effect is modest. Longer gaps → slightly longer cases (perhaps because the account stays “alive” without recent activity)."
"4","`total_collected_since_collection_case_created`","0.031","0.005","The dollar amount already recovered while a case is open has a small protective effect – the more you collect early, the less time you need to keep the case alive."
"5","`has_demand_letter_sent_date` (binary flag)","0.016","0.004","Whether a demand‑letter was ever sent is a weak predictor; cases that trigger a letter tend to be a bit longer, perhaps because they are already more problematic."
"6","`sic_count` (industry code count)","0.010","0.003","Certain SIC codes (industries) are slightly associated with longer collections, but the signal is faint."
"7","`loan_contract_frequency`","0.010","0.003","Borrowers who have many contracts with you tend to generate marginally longer cases – maybe because they have more exposure."
"8","`collection_sub_status`","0.008","0.001","The finer‑grained status inside the main collection bucket adds a tiny amount of information beyond collection_status."
"9–12","`days_funded_to_open`, `borrower_age`, `pg_fico`, `broker`","0.007 → 0.003","≤ 0.005","These are “real‑world” borrower / loan characteristics that have a measurable but secondary effect. Younger borrowers, lower FICO scores and certain brokers slightly increase case length."
"13–15","`percent_paid`, `original_funded_amount`, `can_tier`","≤ 0.003","≤ 0.002","Payment‑completion ratio, loan size, and the “Tier” flag are barely moving the needle."
"16–20","All remaining columns (collection_case_owner, legal_entity_type, concurrent_contract_type, city_and_state, etc.)","≤ 0.001","–","Practically negligible for predicting case length. Some even have negative importance (the model performs slightly better when those columns are shuffled), which usually means the column is noisy or highly correlated with another feature that already captures its information."
"21+","Columns with zero importance (contract_number, borrower, collectin_case_active, etc.)","0.0","0.0","These identifiers add no predictive power – they are either pure IDs or constant within the training split."
